Self Learning
=============

A lightweight, privacy-conscious asset module that injects PostHog into the
Odoo backend so you can see where users get stuck.

Key characteristics
--------------------
* **Dormant by default** — does nothing until a real PostHog project key is set
  under *Settings > Self Learning*.
* **Pseudonymous identity** — users are identified as ``db#uid`` (database name
  plus user id), never by name or email.
* **Per-customer workspace** — each database reports under its own group so data
  never mixes between customers.
* **Privacy first** — all input text is masked, autocapture keeps element text
  out of events, and session replay is disabled.
