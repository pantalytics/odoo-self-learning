# Odoo Self Learning

Product analytics for the **Odoo 19** backend, powered by [PostHog](https://posthog.com).

Odoo Self Learning is a lightweight asset module that injects PostHog into
`web.assets_backend` so you can see where users get stuck: which screens they
open, where they drop off, which flows are slow. No personal data leaves the
browser.

## Highlights

- **Dormant until connected.** Nothing is sent until an administrator presses
  *Connect to Pantalytics* in Settings. The PostHog project key and host arrive
  in a signed entitlement from Pantalytics; no key is typed, shipped or stored
  in a data file. Disconnect (in Odoo or in the Pantalytics panel) and the
  module goes quiet at its next daily check-in.
- **Pseudonymous identity.** Users are identified as `db#uid` (database name +
  user id). Never a name, never an email.
- **Per-customer workspace.** Every database reports under its own PostHog
  group, keyed by the database uuid Pantalytics knows it by, so data never
  mixes between customers.
- **Privacy first.** All input text is masked, autocapture ignores element
  values, and session replay can be switched off per instance.

## Installation

1. Copy the `pan_self_learning` folder into your Odoo addons path.
2. Update the apps list and install **Odoo Self Learning**.
3. Go to **Settings, Odoo Self Learning** and press **Connect to Pantalytics**.
   A tab opens on the Pantalytics panel with the code filled in. Sign in,
   check that the page names this Odoo, press Approve, then come back.

That is the whole setup. The module needs the `cryptography` and `requests`
Python packages, both of which ship with Odoo.

## Configuration

Two privacy switches on the same settings page, stored as system parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `pan_self_learning.enabled` | `True` | Master switch. Off keeps the module dormant even when connected. |
| `pan_self_learning.mask_all_text` | `False` | Also mask all visible text in recordings. |
| `pan_self_learning.disable_session_recording` | `False` | Turn session replay off for this instance. |

For a staging server, two environment variables override where the module
talks to and which signature it trusts: `PAN_SELF_LEARNING_SERVER_URL` and
`PAN_SELF_LEARNING_PUBLIC_KEY`. Never a settings field.

## How it works

Connecting is the device flow Mail Pro uses: Odoo asks the Pantalytics server
for a pairing code, the administrator approves it in their browser, and Odoo
collects an installation key. Once a day the module sends a heartbeat (the
database uuid and two version strings, nothing else) and gets back a signed
entitlement: the PostHog project key and host, and whether sessions may be
recorded. The entitlement is only stored when its Ed25519 signature checks
out against the public key shipped in `models/pan_self_learning_link.py` and
its `db_uuid` matches this database.

On every backend page load, `ir.http.session_info` adds a `pan_self_learning`
block to the session (key, host, pseudonymous `distinct_id`, workspace,
privacy flags) read from that entitlement. The backend asset
`posthog_loader.js` reads it and, only when a key is present, bootstraps
PostHog, identifies the pseudonymous user, and assigns the database as a
`workspace` group.

The server side lives in `pantalytics/odoo-mcp-pro-admin`
(`mcp_server_odoo_admin/apps/self_learning.py`).

## Notes

- The loader fetches `array.js` from the PostHog host named in the
  entitlement. If your backend runs under a strict Content-Security-Policy,
  allow that host in `script-src`/`connect-src`.
- Upgrading from 19.0.1.x removes the pre-filled project key; press Connect to
  Pantalytics once to resume.
